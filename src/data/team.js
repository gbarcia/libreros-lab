  bio: `Dr. Stephania Libreros' laboratory focuses on discovering the biochemical, immunological, and molecular mechanisms that restore systemic and organ-specific homeostasis after pathological challenges, and understanding why these mechanisms sometimes fail, leading to chronic inflammation.

Her goal is to identify new pro-resolving mediators and circuits that enhance host protection, promote microbial clearance, and facilitate tissue regeneration in humans.

Dr. Libreros earned her PhD in Immunology, studying how pre-existing inflammation drives tumor metastasis and myeloid-induced inflammation. She then completed her postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University with Professor Charles N. Serhan, working on structural elucidation of new molecules and networks that control resolution of inflammation.

Dr. Libreros is a consistent advocate for an inclusive environment and promotes equity as a key driver for innovation and scientific progress.`,
